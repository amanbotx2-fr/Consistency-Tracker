## Getting Started (Test Locally with Demo Server)

> **Important:** Always use `demo-server.js` to run and test the project locally. Do not run `server.js` directly.

1. **Clone the repo:**
   ```bash
   git clone <repo-url>
   cd Consistency-tracker
   ```
2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. **Create a `.env` file:**
   ```env
   MONGODB_URI=your_mongodb_atlas_connection_string
   JWT_SECRET=your_super_secret_jwt_key
   ```
4. **Run the demo server:**
   ```bash
   node demo-server.js
   ```
   Or:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
5. **Visit:** `http://localhost:3000`

## MongoDB Atlas Setup
1. Go to [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas/register) and create a free cluster.
2. Add a database user and password.
3. Whitelist your IP (or use `0.0.0.0/0` for development).
4. Copy your connection string and use it as `MONGODB_URI`.

## Development Notes
- This project is actively being developed and improved
- Features may be added, modified, or removed during development
- The codebase is being optimized for both local development and future deployment

---

## Troubleshooting
- **500 Error / Registration fails:** Check your MongoDB URI and JWT secret in `.env`
- **Cannot connect to MongoDB:** Check your Atlas cluster, user, password, and IP whitelist
- **Port already in use:** Change the port in `demo-server.js`
